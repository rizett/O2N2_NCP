This folder contains scripts, forcing data and example output for performing 1D MLD model simulations described in Izett & Tortell (Accepted). 

IzettTortell2020_1d_simulations.m = the main script used to run model simulations
o2arn2_1d_model.m = the model function, which is called-to in the main script, and which uses several ancillary files from /o2n2ar_1d_model/ancillary_scripts
examples = contains forcing data for running simulations.
