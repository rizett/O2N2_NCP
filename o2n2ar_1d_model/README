This folder contains scripts, forcing data and example output for performing 1D MLD model simulations described in Izett & Tortell (In review). 

XXX = the main script used to run model simulations
YYY = the model function, which is called-to in the main script, and which uses several ancillary files from /o2n2ar_1d_model/ancillary_scripts
ZZZ = forcing data for running the real-OSP run c simulation
