This repository consists of a toolbox of Matlab scripts to calculate NCP from O2 and N2 data. Contents include:

A) o2n2ar_1d_model
- code for performing simulations using a 1D mixed layer gas model (details in Izett & Tortell, in prep)
- example data / forcing file to replicate one set of results from Izett & Tortell (in prep)

B) n2prime
- code for calculating N2' (N2-prime) from simulated (see above) and real datasets following Izett & Tortel (in review) and Izett et al. (in prep)
- example data (simulated and real) for calculating N2' and replicating results from Izett & Tortell (in prep) and Izett et al. (in prep)
- output from model simulations described in Izett & Tortell (in review)

C) o2n2_ncp
- code for calculating NCP from underway O2/N2 measurements, following Reuer et al. (2007), Kaiser et al. (2005) and Izett et al., (in prep)

D) ancillary_scripts
- scripts required to run the other scripts listed above
